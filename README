knoda5 is KDE5 port of knoda, a KDE-database frontend based on the hk_classes library.
This package includes also hk_kde5classes, the KDE-widget 
collection of hk_classes.

hk_classes is a set of non-visual routines which allow you to develop
database frontend applications as easy as possible.Optionally you also
can use graphical frontend libraries (e.g. hk_kdeclasses, which is part 
of this package) to write intermediate X-database-applications with just 
a few lines.

You need also a database driver (which is included in the hk_classes 
library) to run applications.

Available drivers are
* mdb (M$ Access),
* Mysql,
* Postgresql,
* SQLite version 2.x,
* SQLite version 3.x and
* ODBC
